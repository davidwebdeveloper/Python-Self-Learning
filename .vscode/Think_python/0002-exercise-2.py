# Exercise 1.2

#  How many seconds in 42 minutes 42 seconds

minutes = 42
seconds = minutes*60 + 42
print(f'{seconds} secodes in 42 minutes 42 seconds')

# How many miles is 10 kilometers

mile = 1.61
result = 10 / 1.61
print(f"{result} miles is 10 kilometers")

# What is your average speed in miles per hour?

hour = seconds / (60*60)
speed = result / hour

print(f"The average speed of the person = {speed}")
